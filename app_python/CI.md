# Continuous Integration (CI) Best Practices

This document outlines the best practices implemented in my GitHub Actions CI workflow for the Python application.

## **CI Workflow Overview**

The CI workflow (`python_app_ci.yml`) is triggered on `pull_request` events that modify files in `app_python/` or the workflow itself. It consists of three key jobs:

1. **Build, Lint, and Test**
2. **Security Check**
3. **Docker Build & Push**

## **Best Practices Implemented**

### ✅ **1. Optimized Dependency Management**

- **Uses `cache: 'pip'`**: This caches Python dependencies to speed up builds.
- **Separate requirements files** (`requirements.txt`, `requirements-dev.txt`): Ensures production and development dependencies are managed separately.

### ✅ **2. Code Quality Assurance**

- **`flake8` for linting**:
  - Enforces PEP8 style.
  - Uses `--max-line-length=88` for better readability.
  - Excludes the virtual environment (`venv`).
- **`pytest` for unit testing**:
  - Ensures core functionalities work as expected.
  - Runs tests with `-v` for detailed output.

### ✅ **3. Security Checks**

- **Integrates Snyk security scanning**:
  - Scans dependencies for vulnerabilities.
  - Uses the `SNYK_TOKEN` secret for authentication.
  - Skips unresolved vulnerabilities to avoid false positives.

### ✅ **4. Safe CI Execution**

- **Job Dependencies (`needs`)**:
  - The **Security Check** runs only after tests pass.
  - **Docker Build & Push** waits for both tests and security scans.

### ✅ **5. Secure Docker Image Handling**

- **Uses `docker/login-action@v3`**: Securely logs into Docker Hub with GitHub Secrets.
- **Two Docker builds**:
  - **Alpine-based image** (lightweight, security-focused).
  - **Distroless-based image** (minimal attack surface).
- **Multi-step image building** ensures optimized layer caching.
